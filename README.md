## How I develped it.

###### To develop it, I first carefully analyzed the requirements and views of the design that they gave me.

**The result of the analysis was:**
1. Identification of the different sections of the site.
2. Individual components for each section of the topic.
3. Colors to use for both themes.

> I worked with CSS variables to can have more control with the colors and the theme switch.

**Challenges while coding**

- When I was doing the theme switch to dark mode some white spaces appear and it took me a while to solved it.
